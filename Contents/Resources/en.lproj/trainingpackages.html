<h2>DAREDEVIL (V)</h2>
<p>Those who risk life and limb for nothing more than fame or fortune are Daredevils. From the death-defying circus performer such as a Trapeze Artist or a Human Cannonball, to the unsung heroics of a Hollywood stuntman, Daredevils have found that the general public is thrilled by hazardous tricks and stunts. Usually the more dangerous a feat is the better it would enthuse a crowd, and they constantly try to dream up new perilous ways to excite onlookers. Out of work pilots from the Great War took up aerial acrobatics during the Pulp-era, becoming known as “Barnstormers,” and often joining Air Circuses. Circus performers began attempting dangerous stunts such as going over waterfalls (such as Niagara) in nothing more than a wooden barrel, or walking a tightrope from skyscraper to skyscraper over busy metropolitan streets. Sitting on top of a flagpole for long periods of time even became a fad during the 1920’s. The Wild West shows churned out their share of Daredevil antics: Sharpshooters, Bronco-busters, lasso-artists, and knife throwers to name a few. Famous Daredevils might include in their ranks the names of Waldo Pepper (Barnstormer), “Buffalo Bill” Cody (cowboy trick shooter), Emanuel Zacchini (Human Cannonball), Jean Lussier (Waterfall Daredevil), Douglas Fairbanks (movie actor; performed all his own stunts).</p>

<h2>DILETTANTE (L)</h2>
<p>Usually born to a noble, or rich family with a large silver spoon in his mouth, the Dilettante rarely cares about any one thing, save perhaps his personal freedom. The idle rich, he has always had the best of everything, and thus lacks many skills that make normal folks...well, normal. He is well-educated, having attended the best (usually Ivy-League) schools. Herein often lies the greatest irony; for the affairs of the Dilettante offer a most unusual “cover” for other, more shadowy practices. Many heroes are Dilettantes in their public (secret) identities, while wearing the mantle of the <a href="#CLOAKED_VIGILANTE">Cloaked Vigilante</a> or <a href="#GANGSTER">Gangster</a> to root out their foes. After all, who else would have the time or cash to traipse about everywhere seeking out enemies to thrash? The Dilettante, of course. Whether a facade masking criminal activities or crime-busting, who would suspect the spoiled rich have any interest in such matters? This cover leaves the Dilettante free to conduct his more important affairs in secret, free from the prying eyes of those who might attempt to hinder him. Famous names among the ranks of Dilettantism might include: Lamont Cranston, Bruce Wayne, Howard Hughes, Richard Wentworth, Richard Curtis Van Loan, and Alphonse Capone.</p>

<h2>FEMME FATALE (V)</h2>
<p>The Femme Fatale is an exercise in seduction. She (a predominantly female vocation) uses those natural gifts to play upon her victim and his resources for her own gain. The seductress will usually present herself as sympathetic to one’s plight until she has attained her goal, then will turn on her “benefactor” and betray him in some fashion, even if it is just abandonment. The Femme Fatale has little sense of morality, and will go to great lengths to accomplish her task. It is not to say she will positively attempt to hurt her victim, whether physically or emotionally, but that she is simply out for herself. If she should desire to continue the relationship, then that becomes one of the goals she will attempt to attain. Many Pulps stereotyped the role as that belonging to an Oriental enchantress, with name-tags like: The Dragon Lady, Serpent Lady, Empress of the East, etc. Infamous Femme Fatales might include: Mata Hari, Thelda Blanchet, Elsa Schneider, Princess Aura, Princess Kojii, and Ayesha-She Who Must Be Obeyed.</p>

Many people are aware of jewelry being buried with a loved one, but the Grave Robber capitalizes on this information. A Grave Robber may seek out ancient grave sites, or even ruins, for their chance at quick and easy money. Of course, most people frown on such activities, and sometimes the dead themselves will rise up to protect their treasure, so though the money maybe quick, it isn’t always easy.</p>

Morality is not in his vocabulary, and he will always possess a nefarious master plan, some dastardly dark design that lurks in the recesses of his criminal mind, patiently awaiting fruition. Whatever his current activities, it can be a sure bet that it will lead to that grand scheme. Insidious Villains are known for their secret hideouts, which are of course filled with countless deathtraps, yet also contain the spoils of their wicked plots.

<p>This is the professional soldier. Be it Army, Navy, Army Air Corps, or Marines, the military life is well established within twentieth century society. Boot camp usually lasts the first three months; then it’s active duty thereafter. In the Militaria, one learns discipline and tactics. During wartime in the Pulp Era, most countries instituted some sort of “draft” to successfully fill out the ranks of their standing army or navy. It is the Militaria’s job to defend its nation’s boundaries, and sometimes to expand them. Famous members of the Militaria might include: <abbr title="General">Gen.</abbr> Douglas MacArthur, George Patton, Dwight Eisenhower, Charles DeGualle, and Admiral Dewey.</p>

Famous Occultists might include: Aleister Crowley, Edgar Cayce, Charles Fort, Professor J.B. Rhine, Charles Dexter Ward, Adolf Hitler,<abbr title="Doctor"> Dr.</abbr> Rudolf Steiner.</p>

Clergy tend to frown on such unorthodox approaches to religion and may even persecute a prophet for heresy. A prophet finds little relief until his message gains acceptance or is proven true. For this reason, a deity only chooses followers of great faith and virtue for such a calling.</p>
