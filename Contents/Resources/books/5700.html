<h1><a name="BO_0.0">0.0</a> WELCOME</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Black Ops source book! Before you undertake the task of figuring out how to assimilate what is found within this tome into your game, a few words of caution and warning arc appropriate.</p>
<p>This source book is "theme" oriented. That is, everything within this book centers around a single theme (in this case&mdash;modern day espionage). If the concept presented in this theme is not appropriate to your game. do not use it! Do not presume that what is written upon these pages is law in the strictest sense. Instead, think of it as a text book from which you will learn how to incorporate certain new concepts into your game. It is possible that what you learn here will contradict the things that you want to pursue in your game. Remember that when anything is in doubt, you (the OM) and your game take precedence&mdash;not the rules.</p>
<p>This book is optional&mdash;everything within it is optional (the training packages, the new professions. etc.). As a GM. you must study what we present here and decide if the concepts are appropriate to your gaming world. Adopting the contents of this book into your game might change the I'"wer halance in your game. You (as the GM) must decide if this is good or bad for your game. Because this book is "theme" oriented. you will probably either adoptthe theme (i.e., the whole book). oronly adopt a very few select pieces of It. If you only adopt select pieces of it (as opposed to the whole thing). be very careful when meshing it wilh the rest of the <em>RMSS</em>; all play-balance put into this book presumes Ihatthewhole book is being used (excluding one part might be excluding a balancing factor). In Ihe end, the GM (not the players) must decide to use (or not use) the material presented herein.</p><p>Players should keep the above discussion in mind when reading <em>Black Ops</em>; the GM may decide that this theme is not appropriate for his game. Pressuring the GM to adopt pieces of this tome might not only result in a fracturing of a delicate game balance, but could weaken or undermine his concepts forthe world he has created. On the other hand, the GM has an obligation to his players to make clear what the physical laws of his world entails (i.e., the game mechanics). Of course, there are always physical laws that are being discovered. A GM must strive to be consistent in his decisions and in his interpretations of the rules (this includes decisions about which rules to include and which to exclude). Without consistency, the players will eventually lose trust and confidence in the GM's decisions and his game. When this happens, a game loses much of its pleasure and appeal.</p>
<blockquote id="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For readability purposes, these rules use the standard masculine pronouns when referring to persons of uncertain gender. In such cases, these pronouns are intended to convey the meanings: he/she, her/him, etc.</blockquote>
<h4><a name="BO_0.0.0.1">0.0.0.1</a> NOTATION</h4>
<p><em>Black Ops</em> use the standard notation from the other products in the <em>RMSS</em> products (e.g., <a href="5520.html"><em>Arms Law</em></a>, <a href="5522.html"><em>Spell Law</em></a>, <a href="5500.html"><em>Rolemaster Standard Rules</em></a>, and <a href="5521.html"><em>Gamemaster Law</em></a>). Those producls should be consulted for speicifc references (e.g., the attack tables all use the <em>AL</em> abbreviations and notation for weapon statistics).</p>
